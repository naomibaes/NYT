    "Aim: This script is designed to parse HTML files containing articles from The New York Times website. It extracts various metadata fields such as the article title, ID, publication date, section, and paragraph text from HTML files and organizes them into a structured format (e.g., CSV or TSV). Additionally, it handles certain cases where the HTML files do not contain actual articles, logging these cases as errors."
